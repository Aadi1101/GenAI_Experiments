# InvoiceVision AI

## Project Description

InvoiceVision AI is an AI-powered tool that extracts and interprets information from multi-language invoice images using Google's Gemini model. It can handle a variety of invoice formats and provide structured outputs for further processing or analysis.

### Features

- **Multi-Language Support:** Accurately extracts information from invoices in different languages.
- **Automated Data Extraction:** Extracts key fields like invoice number, date, amounts, and vendor details.
- **Structured Output:** Generates structured outputs ready for downstream applications or analytics.
- **Image and PDF Support:** Handles both image-based and PDF invoices.
- **Integration Ready:** Can be integrated with finance or accounting systems.

### Purpose

The project helps finance teams, backend developers, and data analysts automate invoice processing, reducing manual errors and saving time.

### How It Works

1. Users upload an invoice image or PDF.
2. The AI parses the document using Google's Gemini model.
3. Extracted data is structured into a readable format.
4. Output can be exported for further processing or integration with other tools.

### Use Cases

- Automating accounts payable and invoice processing.
- Extracting invoice data for reporting and analytics.
- Reducing manual effort in multi-language invoice handling.
- Backend integration for enterprise finance applications.

### Future Enhancements

- Support for more complex invoice templates.
- Real-time validation against vendor databases.
- AI-powered anomaly detection in invoices.
- Cloud deployment for enterprise-level scalability.
