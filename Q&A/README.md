# Gemini QnA

## Project Description

Gemini QnA is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide accurate and context-aware answers to user queries using Googleâ€™s Gemini language model. The project focuses on leveraging state-of-the-art generative AI techniques to enable multi-turn conversational interactions.

### Features

- **Conversational AI:** Supports multi-turn dialogues with context retention.
- **Generative AI:** Utilizes Google Generative AI models to generate answers dynamically.
- **Interactive Web App:** Built using Streamlit for a simple and responsive interface.
- **Image Handling:** Incorporates Pillow for image preprocessing in queries that include images.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Can be extended to handle more datasets or API integrations.

### Purpose

The main objective of Gemini QnA is to demonstrate the capabilities of Generative AI in creating interactive, intelligent chatbots that can provide accurate, contextual answers while maintaining a human-like conversation flow. It is aimed at both experimentation and showcasing AI capabilities in real-world scenarios.

### How It Works

1. User inputs a question or prompt through the Streamlit interface.
2. The system sends the input to the Google Generative AI model.
3. The model processes the query and generates a response considering the previous conversation context.
4. The response is displayed back to the user in real-time.

### Use Cases

- AI assistants for websites or apps
- Customer support automation
- Educational Q&A bots
- AI research and experimentation

### Future Enhancements

- Integration with speech-to-text and text-to-speech modules for voice interaction.
- Support for multimedia queries beyond images.
- Logging and analytics for query trends and performance metrics.
