# IntelliPDF

## Project Description

IntelliPDF is an AI-powered application designed to allow users to query, summarize, and compare PDF documents using Googleâ€™s Gemini language model. The system focuses on enabling efficient information extraction and analysis from PDF files.

### Features

- **Query PDFs:** Users can ask specific questions about PDF content and receive precise answers.
- **Summarization:** Generates concise summaries of PDF documents.
- **Comparison:** Compares multiple PDFs and highlights differences or similarities.
- **Interactive Web App:** Built with Streamlit for ease of use and a responsive interface.
- **Vector Search:** Uses FAISS for semantic search across document embeddings.

### Purpose

The primary goal of IntelliPDF is to provide a streamlined workflow for professionals and researchers to interact with PDF content in an intelligent and efficient manner. It demonstrates how generative AI can be applied to document analysis tasks.

### How It Works

1. Users upload PDF documents via the web interface.
2. The system extracts text and preprocesses the content.
3. Queries are sent to the Google Generative AI model.
4. The AI model generates responses or summaries based on the content of the PDFs.
5. Users receive results directly in the interface for review and further analysis.

### Use Cases

- Research and academic paper analysis
- Business document summarization
- Legal document review
- Automated PDF Q&A and reporting

### Future Enhancements

- Integration with OCR to process scanned PDFs.
- Support for multi-language documents.
- Advanced analytics dashboard for document insights.
- Cloud storage and collaboration features for multiple users.
