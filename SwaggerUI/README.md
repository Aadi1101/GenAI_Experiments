# Swagger Mock Data Generator

## Project Description

Swagger Mock Data Generator is a web application that generates multi-object mock data for testing APIs. It allows developers to define conditional logic, customize data formats, and rapidly produce realistic mock datasets.

### Features

- **Multi-Object Data Generation:** Create multiple types of objects with relational dependencies.
- **Conditional Logic:** Generate data based on predefined conditions and relationships.
- **Custom Formatting:** Format mock data to match API schema or application requirements.
- **Rapid Testing:** Quickly generate large datasets for testing APIs and applications.
- **Integration Support:** Easily integrates with Swagger/OpenAPI specifications.

### Purpose

The project helps backend developers and QA engineers test APIs efficiently by providing realistic mock data that can simulate real-world usage scenarios.

### How It Works

1. Users define object types and fields according to their API schema.
2. Conditional logic and rules are applied to ensure realistic relationships.
3. Mock data is generated in formats such as JSON or CSV.
4. Generated data can be directly used to test APIs or simulate production environments.

### Use Cases

- Backend developers testing API endpoints without actual data.
- QA teams performing automated or manual testing with realistic data.
- Rapid prototyping for applications requiring sample datasets.
- API documentation testing and validation.

### Future Enhancements

- Support for additional output formats (e.g., XML, SQL).
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing.
- AI-assisted data pattern generation for more realistic mock datasets.
- Real-time preview and download options for mock data.
